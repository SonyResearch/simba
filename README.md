# Simba

Official implementation of Simba: Simplicity Bias for Scaling Up Parameters in Deep Reinforcement Learning


## Getting strated

### Docker

We provide a `Dockerfile` for easy installation. You can build the docker image by running

```
docker build . -t simba .
docker run --gpus all -v .:/home/user/simba -it simba /bin/bash
```

### Pip/Conda

If you prefer to install dependencies manually, start by installing dependencies via conda by following the guidelines.
```
# Use pip
pip install -e .

# Or use conda
conda env create -f deps/environment.yaml
```

#### (optional) Jax for GPU
```
pip install -U "jax[cuda12]==0.4.25" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

#### Mujoco
Please see installation instruction at [MuJoCo](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco).
```
# Additional environmental evariables for headless rendering
export MUJOCO_GL="egl"
export MUJOCO_EGL_DEVICE_ID="0"
export MKL_SERVICE_FORCE_INTEL="0"
```

#### (optional) Humanoid Bench

```
git clone https://github.com/joonleesky/humanoid-bench
cd humanoid-bench
pip install -e .
```

#### (optional) Myosuite
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/joonleesky/myosuite
cd myosuite
pip install -e .
```


##  Example usage

We provide examples on how to train SAC agents with SimBa architecture.  

To run a single experiment
```
python run.py
```

To benchmark a simba with running all environments
```
python run_parallel.py \
    --task all \
    --device_ids <list of gpu devices to use> \
    --num_seeds <num_seeds> \
    --num_exp_per_device <number>  
```

### Scripts

An example script to collect DMC results using SAC with Simba:
```
bash scripts/sac_simba_dmc_em.sh
bash scripts/sac_simba_dmc_hard.sh
bash scripts/sac_simba_hbench.sh
bash scripts/sac_simba_myosuite.sh
```
